          <figcaption> 
            From 1995 to 2021, developed countries consistently showed positive net imports of carbon 
            emissions, averaging to 34.2 million tonnes. Conversely, developing countries follow a similar
            yet opposite trend of negative net imports, averaging to -61.0 million tonnes, which indicates 
            a net export. The trend indicates that when imports in developed countries increase, so does 
            exports in developing countries, evidently denoting the correlation of carbon outsourcing of 
            developed nations from developing nations (developed and developing status based on <a href=""></a>).

                    By including multiple annotations within the plot itself, we can highlight important 
                    years (like 2006) and provide concrete numbers, making the takeaway clearer and more
                    accessible. This help guides the viewer’s attention to the crucial factors that support 
                    the main claim — outsourcing of emissions — by emphasizing and contextualizing the 
                    significant difference of net carbon imports during 2006 between developed and developing
                    countries. We also considered just implementing the annotations as concise paragraphs under
                    the graph title. However, this misses the opportunity to directly interpret the context of the 
                    specified years on the chart, limiting its effectiveness in allowing the viewers to grasp in which
                    part of the graph is the annotations talking about (also increases the length of the above 
                    paragraph, making it too wordy). The only potential bias lies in emphasizing a particular 
                    year, which might overstate the importance of a single year, but the intent is explanatory 
                    rather than manipulative.

                    The use of blue and red colors makes a clear visual distinction between developed and 
                    developing countries, allowing viewers to better understand which line represents which
                    classification. The color blue symbolizes stability and professionalism, fitting for 
                    developed countries. The color red symbolizes urgency and imbalance, reflecting the 
                    challenges encountered by developing countries. This color contrast also stresses the 
                    diverging differences between the two groups, helping viewers associate import as developed
                    countries and export as developing countries. At first, we thought about using the color 
                    green for developed countries, but green might be affiliated with environmentally friendly
                    solutions, which might stray the focus away from our main argument that argues against 
                    the eco-friendliness of developed countries. However, one possible downside of using the 
                    color red is that it may subconsciously suggest “bad,” slightly moralizing the developing 
                    countries’ role, but this was outweighed by clarity and interpretability.

                    Through a common y-axis for the net imports of both developed and developing countries,
                    the viewers can get a better understanding of import and export carbon flows over the years
                    with direct comparisons, making it obvious that developed nations import carbon (positive, above 0) 
                    and developing nations export carbon (negative, below 0). This also ensures that both trends are 
                    fairly evaluated with the same scale, preventing axis manipulations that exaggerate the results. 
                    Although we considered implementing two separate y-axes, we thought it would be less intuitive and 
                    less visually striking since both imports and exports follow similar trends. Therefore, we decided not 
                    to over complicate the visualization and used a single axis instead. Even though the single axis can 
                    provide clarity, it may also be confusing for viewers as to how a negative carbon net <em>import</em>
                    corresponds to <em>export</em> when the phrase is literally import, not export. However, this is covered
                    through the explanation on top of the graph, stating that <em>Net Imports = Imports - Exports</em>.

                    By displaying the mean values of net imports and exports for developed and developing countries, 
                    viewers can comprehend not just the trend of the annual net imports, but the summary of the long
                    term trends as well. The averages help reinforce the fact that the observed pattern isn’t 
                    temporary or random, but rather a consistent trend of over 20 plus years. This is an honest 
                    technique aggregate complex data into a clear message that suggests that developed countries have 
                    always been importing carbon to lower their own carbon footprints, better persuading the viewers 
                    for our main claim. We also considered the use of trend lines to show the general direction of 
                    net imports over time, but the trends (positive/negative slopes) can be easily distinguished by
                    viewers even without such lines. Moreover, the averages provide an additional data to better 
                    contextualize the volume of net imports between developed and developing countries that viewers
                    can easily compare with. However, a possible downside is that averages can oversimplify temporal 
                    variations. Yet, their small text annotations and dotted lines prevent them from obscuring any 
                    relevant trends over the years.

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>Overall, our design process was pretty straightforward: it is to show the difference in net 
            imported carobon between developed and developing countries over the years. Therefore, we 
            settled on using a line graph to better show the trends of how nations import or export carbon
            emissions. By doing so, we can effectively visualize how developed countries are importing
            carbon from developing countries to decrease their own national carbon emission levels, thus 
            making them look more eco-friendly. However, the more difficult part was to make a deceptive 
            visualization that argues the opposite. We had many ideas as to how to aggregate and portray 
            the data to show that both developed and developing countries have similar levels of emissions 
            despite the imports and exports. For instance, we thought of using rolling averages to minimize 
            peaks, changing country classification to include china and india as their gross outputs are 
            considered developed even though that isn't the case per capita, and altering y-axis values 
            to percent changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            We think that the definition of “ethical analysis and visualization” is the development of 
            visualizations through fair, thoughtful, and truthful representations. Although it is 
            difficult to draw any bounds on what is considered to be “fair” and “truthful” when one is 
            trying to persuade the other without misleading them, I think that one bound is that 
            visualizations should include almost all valid datapoints. This is because in the case of 
            Graph 3, I purposefully removed a lot of data from 1970 to 2004 just to show a trend that 
            occurred for a short period of time instead of showing the entire picture, which can mislead 
            people into believing that data from 2005 to 2020 represents all historical data. However, 
            I believe that it is “acceptable” to remove a few data points (just not entire sections of 
            data), especially extreme outliers, to not let certain “flukes” or “random chances” affect 
            the overall visualization.
